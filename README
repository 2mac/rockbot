rockbot
=======

Yet another extensible IRC bot written in Ruby.

Why?
----

I wanted to. Get over it.

How?
----

Write up a config file and run `rockbot.rb`. See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for
details of the configuration.

If you want to use plugins which require a database, you'll need to install the
`sequel` and `sqlite3` gems.

Documentation
-------------

You can generate API documentation by running

    $ rdoc

The documentation will be placed in the `doc/` directory.
